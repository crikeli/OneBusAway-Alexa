# OneBusAway-Alexa
An amazon alexa skill that taps into data from the One Bus Away API and provides a voice interaction medium between the user and an acceptable amazon alexa enabled device(Echo or Dot)...This is an on-going project.


The motivation for this project is:
1) Curiosity - With voice-user-interaction on the come-up, I believe there is a huge prospect in advancement.
2) Developing a deeper understanding of working with external api's, manipulating data and communicating a process through technology.
3) Better understand natural human conversation in relation to the current capabilites of Alexa.

My personal goals for this project are :

1) To create a natural voice-user-interaction that yields a result that is satisfactory and relevant.(achieved).
2) To understand how all the elements coalesce together, in this case the data I retrieve from the One-Bus-Away API and the Alexa Skills Kit SDK.(achieved).
3) To give users the opportunity to save multiple bus-stop id's by giving them relatable names (eg. Alexa, give me the next scheduled arrival for 5th and Pike).(To be achieved).
